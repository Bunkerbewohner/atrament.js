Atrament is a library that enables the user to draw smooth, natural drawings and handwriting on the HTML canvas.
The algorithm was originally developed about 2 weeks after I started learning JavaScript, as I wanted to build a
collaborative drawing space on the web, which ended up being [1WALL](http://fiala.uk/1wall). I wanted the drawing to
feel natural and comfortable, and the result to be smooth and pleasing. Years later, I've taken the algorithm,
improved it, rewrote it in ES6 and made it into a neat little library.

[Here's a basic demo.](http://fiala.uk/atrament.js/demo/)

Enjoy!

## Installation

#### as a module

If you're using a tool like webpack or browserify to bundle your code, you can install it using npm.

+ install atrament as a dependency using ```npm install --save atrament```.
+ You can access the Atrament class using ```const Atrament = require('atrament');```

#### script tag

Include the script located at [dist/atrament.min.js](https://github.com/jakubfiala/atrament.js/raw/master/dist/atrament.min.js) in the `<head>` tag of your HTML.

Alternatively, you can use Bower: `bower install atrament` and include `bower_components/atrament/dist/atrament.min.js` as a script tag.

#### polymer

Thanks to [rubenstolk](https://github.com/rubenstolk), you can also use the [sc-atrament](https://github.com/safetychanger/sc-atrament) Polymer element.

## Usage

+ create a `<canvas>` tag, e.g.:
```html
<canvas id="sketchpad" width="500" height="500">
```
+ in your JavaScript, create an `Atrament` instance passing it your canvas object:
```js
const canvas = document.querySelector('#sketchpad');
const sketchpad = new Atrament(canvas);
```
+ you can also pass the width, height and default colour to the constructor:
```js
const sketchpad = new Atrament(canvas, { width: 500, height: 500, color: 'orange' });
```
+ that's it, happy drawing!


## Options & config

+ clear the canvas:
```js
sketchpad.clear();
```
+ change the line thickness:
```js
sketchpad.weight = 20; //in pixels
```
+ change the color:
```js
sketchpad.color = '#ff485e'; //just like CSS
```
+ toggle between modes:
```js
sketchpad.mode = 'erase'; 	// eraser tool
sketchpad.mode = 'fill'; 	// click to fill area
sketchpad.mode = 'draw'; 	// default
```
+ toggle smoothing - having it on makes the drawings look much better, turning it off makes it feel a bit more responsive. `true` by default.
```js
sketchpad.smoothing = false;
```
+ toggle adaptive stroke, i.e. line width changing based on drawing speed for a more natural effect. `true` by default.
```js
sketchpad.adaptiveStroke = false;
```
+ change the opacity:
```js
sketchpad.opacity = 0.5; //number between 0-1
```
+ export as image:
```js
//we have to get the dataURL of the image
const dataURL = sketchpad.toImage();
//then we can, for instance, open a new window with it
window.open(dataURL);
```
+ `dirty` event â€“ do something when the canvas becomes dirty:
```js
// this also fires when you clear the canvas
// the dirty property is then false
// note that we attach the event to canvas
canvas.addEventListener('dirty', e => console.info(sketchpad.dirty));
```

## Development
To obtain the dependencies, `cd` into the atrament directory and run `npm install`.
You should be able to then build atrament by simply running `npm run build`.

I didn't bother writing tests because it's such a small package. Contributions are welcome!
